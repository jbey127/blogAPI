    - Utilize a larger database to handle more complex data projects

Stage 6: More than just a blog API

With a postgres or MongoDb set up I should be able to utilize this environment for future projects via the API. 
I will create new endpoints for each project and develop a way to utilize the programs behind them with specific data structures.
